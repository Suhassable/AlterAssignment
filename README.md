## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### 1. Set Up GCP Bucket

-Create a GCP bucket that will be used to dump uploaded files



### 2. Configure the API Code

- Go to the `api/` folder
- Replace the placeholder GCP bucket name in the code with your actual bucket name.
- This cloud run api will give us  three endpoints for ingestion, user data retrival and similar users.

### 3. Deploy API Service to Cloud Run

- Push the repo to GitHub
- Deploy the `api/` service to Cloud Run via the GitHub repo

> üí° Make sure to enable Cloud Build and Cloud Run services in your GCP project.

### 4. Grant Permissions to Service Account

Give the deployed Cloud Run service account permission to write to the GCP bucket:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \
  --member="serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]" \
  --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"
```

---

### 5. Deploy Second Cloud Run Function

Deploy the second service using `Second Cloud Function.py`. This service will be triggered by Eventarc:

- Create a new Cloud Run Function service for it
- Deploy it as you did with the main API
- This function will clean and load data into our MongoDB database. 
- Also done user segmentation in this function.


### 6. Configure Eventarc Trigger

Create an Eventarc trigger that listens to the GCP bucket and calls the second Cloud Run service:

```bash
gcloud eventarc triggers create file-upload-trigger \
  --destination-run-service=[SECOND_FUNCTION_NAME] \
  --destination-run-region=[REGION] \
  --event-filters="type=google.cloud.storage.object.v1.finalized" \
  --event-filters="bucket=[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME]" \
  --service-account=[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]
```

---

### 7. Set Up MongoDB Atlas

-Create MongoDB atlas cluster which will we use to store cleaned user data.
- We are using MongoDB because it provide vector search which ww will using for finding similar users.
- Set up a database and collection

### 8. Setup Triggers for MongoDB

- Setup Triggers using triggers.js file for update and insert action in collection.
- Create trigger function using Trigger_Function.py update url into mongodb triggers.
-This trigger will add embeddings to document when it is updated or new document inserted into database.

### 9. User segmentation 

- We areusing openai model for user segmentation by doing prompt enginnering.
- We can improve model result by fine tuning model.
- TO fine tune the model create data accoring to result you want. e.g. prompt : response
- Train model on that data and use fine tuned model for user segmentation.

### EDA 

- In eda.ipynb file we have done some eda to uncover relation between different datapoints.



## üîå API Endpoints

### 1. `/upload'`

**Method:** `POST`  
**Description:** Upload a CSV or JSON file. The file is dumped into GCP bucket and processed into MongoDB.

---

### 2. `/user`

**Method:** `GET`  
**Query Params:** `email` or `cookie`  
**Description:** Retrieve user data by email or cookie.

---

### 3. `/similar_users`

**Method:** `GET`  
**Query Params:** `email` or `cookie`  
**Description:** Returns users similar to the provided user based on embeddings.

## Similarity  Information
In this project, the `similar-user` endpoint utilizes **cosine similarity** and **MongoDB's Vector Search** to identify users with comparable profiles.ÓàÜ

**Cosine Similarity:**
This metric measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, indicating their directional similarity. A value of 1 signifies identical orientation (maximum similarity), 0 indicates orthogonality (no similarity), and -1 denotes opposite orientation (maximum dissimilarity). This approach is effective in high-dimensional spaces, such as user attribute embeddings. ÓàÄciteÓàÇturn0search0ÓàÅÓàÜ

**MongoDB's Vector Search:**
MongoDB Atlas provides native support for vector search, allowing storage and querying of vector embeddings alongside operational data. This integration facilitates semantic searches within your database. ÓàÄciteÓàÇturn0search2ÓàÅÓàÜ

By combining these technologies, the application retrieves users whose profile vectors closely align with the target user's vector, enabling efficient and accurate identification of similar users.ÓàÜ

## üìù Notes

- Make sure your MongoDB connection string and OpenAI API key are securely stored (e.g., via environment variables or Secret Manager)
- Service accounts need proper access to GCS and Cloud Run
- You can extend the embeddings logic by modifying `triggers.js`
- You can use data proc clusters for function-2 which handle data cleaning and loading it into database and user segmentation
